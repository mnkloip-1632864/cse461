README for project 2:

For compilation and running, unzip code.zip and make sure you are in the code directory (the directory with the build.xml file)

Compilation can be performed by running the command: ant compile
Running: ant
     or: ant jar
will cause the source files to be compiled and packaged into an executable jar file. The jar file is stored as Project2.jar and is located in the root directory (same directory as build.xml).

To run the server use the command: ant run
or alternatively create the jar (through 'ant' or 'ant jar') and run:
java -jar Project2.jar

Our main class is: src/project2/Project2Main.java
